# Hello-World
Richter: Die monster. You don’t belong in this world!

Dracula: It was not by my hand that I am once again given flesh.
         I was called here by humans who wish to pay me tribute.

Richter: Tribute!?!         
         You steal men’s souls and make them your slaves!

Dracula: Perhaps the same could be said of all religions…

Richter: Your words are as empty as your soul!
         Mankind ill needs a savior such as you!
         
Dracula: What is a man? A miserable little pile of secrets.
         But enough talk… Have at you!
